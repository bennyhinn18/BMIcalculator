# Exercise 3: Unit Converter

## Objective
Develop a cross-platform application to convert units from imperial system to metric system (km to miles, kg to pounds, etc.)

## Features (To be implemented)
- [ ] Multiple unit conversion categories
- [ ] Real-time conversion as user types
- [ ] Conversion history
- [ ] Bi-directional conversion
- [ ] Popular conversions quick access
- [ ] Precision control

## Conversion Categories
- **Length**: km ↔ miles, meters ↔ feet, cm ↔ inches
- **Weight**: kg ↔ pounds, grams ↔ ounces
- **Temperature**: Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin
- **Volume**: liters ↔ gallons, ml ↔ fluid ounces
- **Area**: sq meters ↔ sq feet, hectares ↔ acres

## Technology Stack
- React Native with Expo
- Custom conversion algorithms
- React Navigation for category screens
- AsyncStorage for conversion history

## Setup Instructions
**Coming Soon** - This exercise will be implemented in the next phase of the laboratory.

## Learning Outcomes
- Mathematical calculations in mobile apps
- Multi-screen navigation
- Data formatting and presentation
- User input handling
- Algorithm implementation
